    <p>My name is Basavaraj Malagi. I hail from Bangalore, Karnataka, and I am a recent graduate with a strong passion for the IT industry, particularly in the field of development.
        Regarding my educational qualifications, I completed my 10th at S.G High School, Maradimath, and my 12th at Government College, Majalatti. I pursued my Bachelor of Engineering at Angadi Institute of Technology and Management under VTU University.Throughout my academic journey, I achieved commendable percentages.<br> Im good with HEML, Css, js, sql, java<br>
        In terms of practical experience, I have successfully completed three projects. One project focused on artificial intelligence, while the other two were centered around full-stack web development. The first of these two projects is a Courier Management System designed to provide timely updates and track courier information, utilizing Java for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The second project, a Vehicle Service Management System, efficiently tracks and schedules vehicle maintenance, including oil and wheel changes. It manages mechanic services and employs Java for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.
        The third project involves machine learning, specifically lung cancer detection using lung CT image processing. We utilized the Single Shot Detection algorithm for medical X-ray image analysis, ensuring high accuracy in disease detection. Flask served as the frontend, while Python handled the backend.
        As for my goals, my short-term objective is to secure a position in your esteemed company to further explore and apply my skills. In the long term, I aspire to become a valuable contributor wherever I go. This encapsulates my introduction. Thank you for providing me with this opportunity.</p><br>
